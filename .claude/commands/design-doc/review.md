# /design-doc:review - AI Review of Design Documents

**Purpose**: Automatically review design documents using multiple AI models (Gemini + Ollama/Codex) with Claude as a guaranteed fallback. Identifies architectural issues, ADR compliance, blind spots, and provides actionable feedback before human review.

**Usage**:
- `/design-doc:review REC-XX` - Review with both models + Claude fallback if needed
- `/design-doc:review REC-XX --model gemini` - Gemini only
- `/design-doc:review REC-XX --model ollama` - Ollama only
- `/design-doc:review REC-XX --persona all` - Run all domain-specific persona reviews
- `/design-doc:review` - Interactive mode

**Resilience guarantees**:
- Pre-flight health check skips unreachable models immediately (no 5-minute timeout waste)
- Empty output short-circuit avoids burning validator API calls on trivially detectable failures
- Gemini falls back to `GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL` after empty output from primary model
- Claude fallback reviewer activates when both external models fail - at least one review is always produced
- Synthesis adapts format: multi-review (Agreement/Disagreement) vs single-review (Key Findings)

## Key Differences: Gemini vs Ollama (via Codex)

| Aspect | Gemini (via opencode) | Ollama (Codex) |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **File Reading** | Agent reads files itself | Shell commands in read-only sandbox (`cat`, `find`, `head`) |
| **Directory Access** | Full project read access from the run directory | Full project read access via `--sandbox read-only` |
| **Approach** | Model reads files itself | Agent reads files via shell |
| **Command** | `opencode run --model "google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview" --agent plan -- "..."` | `ollama launch codex --model MODEL -- exec "..." --sandbox read-only --oss --local-provider ollama` |
| **Sandbox** | opencode `plan` agent (read-only, no edits) | Codex `--sandbox read-only` (no writes allowed) |

The standalone `gemini` CLI is deprecated. Reach Gemini only through
`opencode run --model "google/$MODEL"`, matching `.lok/workflows/*.toml`.

---

## When to Use

This command is typically invoked:
1. Automatically by `/task:orchestrate` after `/design-doc:create` completes
2. Manually when requesting an AI review of any design document

---

## Unified Review Prompt

**Both Gemini and Codex receive the same review prompt.** Only the file-reading instructions differ slightly.

```
You are a senior software architect reviewing a design document.

TASK: Review the design document at: docs/designs/[DESIGN_DOC_FILENAME]

Read these files to gather context:
1. docs/designs/[DESIGN_DOC_FILENAME] — The design document to review
2. docs/arch/ — Architecture documents (read all .md files in this directory)
3. docs/adrs/ — Architecture Decision Records (60+ files). List filenames first, then read ONLY the ADRs relevant to this design document's topic (typically 5-10 most relevant)
4. docs/ROADMAP.md — Current project phase and task status
5. docs/DEPENDENCIES.md — Task dependency graph
6. docs/PROJECT.md — Active work and blockers

If the design document references specific source files, read those too for validation.

PROJECT CONTEXT:
- This is a Rust crate (Cargo, edition 2021) named remem-ai - a local-first coding-agent memory system for Claude Code and OpenAI Codex; lib `remem`, bin `remem`

## Command Execution Instructions

### Step 1: Extract Task Number and Model Selection

1. **Parse arguments**:
   - Extract task number (e.g., `REC-21` or `rec-21`)
   - Check for `--model gemini`, `--model ollama`, or default to both
   - Check for `--persona [security|concurrency|backend-integration|all]` (optional, adds domain-specific reviews)

2. **If no task number provided**:
   - Ask: "Which design document do you want to review? (e.g., REC-21)"
   - Wait for response

### Step 2: Locate Design Document

```bash
ls docs/designs/rec-XX-*.md
```

**If NOT found**:
```
ERROR: Design document not found
Expected: docs/designs/rec-XX-*.md
Create one first: /design-doc:create REC-XX
```
Exit command.

**If found**: Note the full filename (e.g., `rec-21-websocket-handler.md`)

### Step 3: Verify Context Files

Verify these files exist (both models need them):
- `docs/designs/rec-XX-*.md` — The design document to review
- `docs/arch/` — Architecture documents directory
- `docs/adrs/` — Architecture Decision Records (60+ files)
- `docs/ROADMAP.md` — Project phases and task status
- `docs/DEPENDENCIES.md` — Task dependency graph
- `docs/PROJECT.md` — Active work and blockers

If any are missing, warn but proceed.

### Step 4: Create Reviews Directory

```bash
mkdir -p docs/reviews
```

### Step 5: Build the Review Prompt

Construct the unified prompt (from the template above) by replacing `[DESIGN_DOC_FILENAME]` with the actual filename. **Both models get the same prompt.**

### Step 6: Run AI reviews via lok

Run the lok design-review workflow. The workflow executes this pipeline:

1. **Health check** (10s) - verifies Gemini CLI and Ollama are reachable. Unreachable models are skipped immediately instead of timing out after 300s.
2. **Gemini review** (up to 300s) - runs primary model, falls back to `GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL` on empty output.
3. **Ollama review** (up to 300s) - runs in parallel with Gemini, short-circuits on empty output.
4. **Claude fallback** (up to 120s) - runs only if both Gemini and Ollama failed. Reads the design doc and context files directly to guarantee at least one review.
5. **Synthesis** - cross-references all successful reviews, includes reviewer status table with failure reasons.
6. **Write files** - saves individual reviews and synthesis.

Run in background:
```bash
lok run .lok/workflows/design-review.toml \
  "docs/designs/[DESIGN_DOC_FILENAME]" \
  "rec-[XX]" \
  --dir . \
  --verbose
```

This produces:
- `docs/reviews/rec-[XX]-review-gemini.md` (validated Gemini review or REVIEW_FAILED)
- `docs/reviews/rec-[XX]-review-ollama.md` (validated Ollama review or REVIEW_FAILED)
- `docs/reviews/rec-[XX]-review-claude-fallback.md` (only if both external models failed)
- `docs/reviews/rec-[XX]-review-synthesis.md` (cross-referenced synthesis with reviewer status)

### Step 7: Save Review Outputs

**Gemini review**: `docs/reviews/rec-XX-review-gemini.md`
**Ollama review**: `docs/reviews/rec-XX-review-ollama.md`

**Format for each**:
```markdown
# Design Review: REC-XX - [Title]

**Reviewed**: [Current Date YYYY-MM-DD]
**Reviewer**: [Gemini 3.1 Pro | Codex via Ollama (glm-5:cloud)]
**Design Document**: docs/designs/rec-XX-[description].md
**Review Duration**: [X seconds]

---

[AI REVIEW OUTPUT]

---

*This review was automatically generated. Human judgment should be applied when interpreting these suggestions.*
```

### Step 7.5: Run Persona Reviews (if --persona flag provided)

If `--persona` flag was provided, run additional domain-specific reviews. These run as Claude subagents, each reading the persona template and the design document.

**Available personas** (templates in `.claude/templates/review-personas/`):

| Persona | Template | Focus |
|---------|----------|-------|
| `security` | `review-personas/security.md` | API key handling, process execution, input validation |
| `concurrency` | `review-personas/concurrency.md` | Async safety, tokio patterns, race conditions |
| `backend-integration` | `review-personas/backend-integration.md` | Backend trait, error handling, timeout management |

**For each requested persona** (or all three if `--persona all`):

1. Read the persona template from `.claude/templates/review-personas/{persona}.md`
2. Build the persona review prompt by combining the template's review prompt with:
   - The design document path
   - Relevant source files (based on persona focus)
   - The persona's output format
3. Run as a subagent (Agent tool) with the persona prompt
4. Save output to `docs/reviews/rec-XX-review-{persona}.md`

**Output files**: `docs/reviews/rec-XX-review-security.md`, etc.

---

### Step 8: Analyze All Reviews and Produce Synthesis

After all reviews complete (Gemini + Ollama + optional personas), read all review files and produce a synthesis following the template at `.claude/templates/review-synthesis.md`:

```markdown
## Review Synthesis

### Agreement (High Confidence)
[Items where 2+ reviewers independently identified the same concern]

### Disagreement (Needs Human Decision)
[Items where reviewers hold divergent positions]

### Novel Insights (Single Reviewer)
[Items found by only one reviewer]

### Persona Summary (if applicable)
| Persona | Verdict | Key Finding |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Audio Safety | [verdict] | [1-line summary] |
| FFI Safety | [verdict] | [1-line summary] |
| State Machine | [verdict] | [1-line summary] |

### Consolidated Verdict
[Apply consensus rules: ANY NEEDS_REVISION -> NEEDS_REVISION, all APPROVE -> APPROVE, else APPROVE_WITH_SUGGESTIONS]

### Priority Actions
1. [Highest priority - agreement items first]
2. [Second priority]
3. [Third priority]
```

Save synthesis to `docs/reviews/rec-XX-review-synthesis.md`.

### Step 9: Return Summary

```

## Error Handling

**Check review results**

Read `docs/reviews/rec-[XX]-review-synthesis.md`. The synthesis always starts with a **Reviewer Status** table showing which models succeeded, failed, or were skipped.

**Interpreting the synthesis:**

| Scenario | Synthesis format | What happened |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| 2+ reviews valid | Multi Review (Agreement/Disagreement/Novel) | Normal multi-perspective synthesis |
| 1 review valid | Single Review (Key Findings) | One external model + possibly Claude fallback |
| Claude fallback only | Single Review, source = Claude | Both external models failed, fallback activated |
| `NO_REVIEWS_AVAILABLE` | Status table only | All reviewers failed (rare - Claude fallback should prevent this) |

**Failure diagnostics:**

The Reviewer Status table in the synthesis includes failure reasons inline:

```
## Reviewer Status
| Reviewer | Status | Detail |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Gemini | REVIEW_FAILED | Network timeout after 300s |
| Ollama | REVIEW_FAILED | Empty output, CLI startup failure |
| Claude (fallback) | OK | Produced full review |
```

For deeper diagnostics:
- Gemini stderr: `/tmp/lok-gemini-stderr.log`
- Ollama stderr: `/tmp/lok-ollama-stderr.log`

**The `NO_REVIEWS_AVAILABLE` case should be rare.** The Claude fallback reviewer has no external dependencies - it reads files directly. If even the fallback fails, it indicates a problem with the lok pipeline itself, not network issues.

## Configuration

### Default Models

| Provider | Model | Integration | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Gemini | `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` | Gemini CLI | Explicitly set via `--model` flag to prevent auto-routing to Flash |
| Ollama | `glm-5:cloud` | Codex | `ollama launch codex --model MODEL --oss --local-provider ollama` |

### Environment Variables

- `GEMINI_MODEL` - Override default Gemini model (default: `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`)
- `GEMINI_FALLBACK_MODEL` - Gemini model to try when primary returns empty output (default: `gemini-2.5-pro`)
- `OLLAMA_MODEL` - Override default Ollama model (default: `glm-5:cloud`)
- `GEMINI_TIMEOUT` - Override Gemini timeout in seconds (default: 300)
- `OLLAMA_TIMEOUT` - Override Ollama timeout in seconds (default: 300)

## Output Files

| File | Purpose | When created |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `docs/reviews/rec-XX-review-gemini.md` | Gemini AI review | Always (may contain REVIEW_FAILED) |
| `docs/reviews/rec-XX-review-ollama.md` | Codex/Ollama AI review | Always (may contain REVIEW_FAILED) |
| `docs/reviews/rec-XX-review-claude-fallback.md` | Claude fallback review | Only when both external models failed |
| `docs/reviews/rec-XX-review-synthesis.md` | Cross-referenced synthesis with reviewer status | Always |
