# /plan:implement - Implement Plans Step-by-Step with Progress Tracking

**Purpose**: Execute implementation plans from `docs/plan/` by running tasks phase-by-phase, updating progress dynamically, and syncing status to Linear.

**Usage**:
- `/plan:implement [rec-XX]` - Implement specific task plan
- `/plan:implement` - Interactive mode

---

## Project Context

| Setting | Value |
|---------|-------|
| Linear Workspace | cloud-ai |
| Issue Prefix | REC (e.g., REC-123) |
| Branch Format | `{prefix}/rec-<number>-<short-desc>` (prefix: feat, fix, chore) |

---

## Command Execution Instructions

When this command is invoked, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Extract Task Number

1. **If user provided task number** (e.g., `/plan:implement rec-36`):
   - Extract the REC-XX identifier
   - Normalize to uppercase for Linear (e.g., "rec-36" -> "REC-36")
   - Keep lowercase for file matching (e.g., "rec-36")
   - Proceed to Step 2

2. **If no task number provided** (e.g., `/plan:implement`):
   - Ask user: "Which Linear task plan do you want to implement? (e.g., REC-36)"
   - Wait for response
   - Extract and normalize the task number
   - Proceed to Step 2

### Step 2: Locate Required Files

**Plan File (REQUIRED)**:

1. Search for plan file: `docs/plan/rec-XX-*.md`
2. **If NOT found**:
   - Display error: "Plan file not found matching: docs/plan/rec-XX-*.md"
   - Suggest: "Run `/plan:create rec-XX` first to generate the implementation plan"
   - Exit command
3. **If found**: Extract full filename, continue

**Design Document (OPTIONAL)**:

1. Search for design doc: `docs/designs/rec-XX-*.md`
2. **If found**: Will use for context during implementation
3. **If NOT found**: Continue with warning
   - Display: "Design document not found. Will implement based on plan file only."

**Architecture Reference (ALWAYS READ IF EXISTS)**:

1. Read `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` or `docs/adr/`
2. Use for architecture context, patterns, and validation

**Status File (AUTO-CREATE & AUTO-UPDATE)**:

1. Check if status file exists: `docs/status/rec-XX-*.md`
2. **If found**: Read to understand current progress and decisions
3. **If NOT found**: **Create immediately before starting execution**

**Status file is updated**:
- At the START of implementation (created if missing)
- After EACH task completion (add completed task entry)
- After EACH phase completion (add phase summary)
- At the END of implementation session (final status)

**Proceed to Step 2.5: Initialize Status File**

### Step 2.5: Initialize Status File

**CRITICAL: Create status file before any implementation work begins.**

**Create directory if needed**:
```bash
mkdir -p docs/status
```

**If status file doesn't exist**, create `docs/status/rec-XX-[description].md`:

```markdown
# REC-XX: [Task Title]

**Linear Task**: https://linear.app/cloud-ai/issue/REC-XX
**Plan File**: docs/plan/rec-XX-[description].md
**Design Document**: docs/designs/rec-XX-[description].md (or "N/A")
**Started**: [Current Date/Time]
**Last Updated**: [Current Date/Time]

---

## Current Status: In Progress

**Overall Progress**: 0% (0/[total] tasks)
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 - [Name]

---

## Session Log

### Session 1 - [Date]

**Started**: [Time]
**Branch**: feat/rec-XX-[description]

#### Tasks Completed This Session

[Will be populated as tasks complete]

---

## Completed Phases

[Will be populated as phases complete]

---

## Technical Decisions

[Key decisions made during implementation]

---

## Important Findings

[Insights discovered during implementation]

---

## Questions & Blockers

[Open questions or blocking issues]

---

## Next Steps

[What needs to happen next]
```

**If status file already exists**:
- Read current state
- Add new session entry:

```markdown
### Session N - [Date]

**Started**: [Time]
**Resuming from**: [Last completed task]
**Branch**: feat/rec-XX-[description]

#### Tasks Completed This Session

[Will be populated]
```

**Proceed to Step 3**

### Step 3: Parse Plan File and Build Execution Queue

**Read plan file** and extract:

1. **Current progress line**: `Overall Progress: X% (Y/Z tasks completed)`
2. **All tasks with status markers**:
   - `[ ]` = To do (queue for execution)
   - `[~]` = In progress (resume from here)
   - `[x]` = Done (skip)
   - `[!]` = Blocked (skip, needs manual intervention)

**Calculate statistics**:

```
Total tasks: Count all checkboxes ([ ], [~], [x], [!])
Completed tasks: Count [x] only
Pending tasks: Count [ ] and [~]
Blocked tasks: Count [!]
Progress percentage: (completed / total) * 100
```

**Build execution queue** (phase-by-phase):

```
Phase 1: [Phase Name]
  - [x] Task 1.1 [SKIP - already done]
  - [ ] Task 1.2 [QUEUE - add to execution list]
  - [ ] Task 1.3 [QUEUE - add to execution list]

Phase 2: [Phase Name]
  - [ ] Task 2.1 [QUEUE - add to execution list]
```

**Intelligent Resume Logic**:

- If task is `[x]`: Skip entirely (already completed)
- If task is `[~]`: Add to queue first (was interrupted)
- If task is `[ ]`: Add to queue in order
- If task is `[!]`: Skip (requires manual intervention)

**Display execution summary to user**:

```
PLAN ANALYSIS: REC-XX

Total tasks: 20
Completed: 8 (40%)
Pending: 11
Blocked: 1

Next execution queue: 11 tasks across 3 phases

Phases to execute:
- Phase 2: Core Implementation (1 in progress, 2 pending)
- Phase 3: Testing & Validation (4 pending)
- Phase 4: Finalization (4 pending)

Blocked tasks (will skip):
- Phase 2: External API integration (marked [!])

Ready to start implementation? (yes/no)
```

### Step 3.5: Git Branch Management

**Purpose**: Ensure work happens on a feature branch.

**Branch naming convention**:
- Features: `feat/rec-XX-short-description`
- Bug fixes: `fix/rec-XX-short-description`

#### Check Current Branch

```bash
git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD
```

#### Branch Decision Logic

**Case A: On main branch**

```
BRANCH CHECK: Currently on main

Implementation will create commits for REC-XX.
These commits should be on a feature branch, not main.

Suggested branch name: feat/rec-XX-[short-description]

Options:
1. [create] - Create feature branch and switch to it (recommended)
2. [stay] - Stay on main (NOT recommended)
3. [cancel] - Exit command

Your choice:
```

**Handle user response**:
- **create**: Create and switch to `feat/rec-XX-short-desc`
- **stay**: Warn and continue on main
- **cancel**: Exit command

**Case B: On feature branch matching task**

Example: On `feat/rec-10-websocket` when implementing REC-10

```
BRANCH CHECK: Currently on feat/rec-10-websocket

This matches task REC-10. Continuing implementation on this branch.
```

Continue to Step 4.

**Case C: On feature branch NOT matching task**

```
BRANCH CHECK: Currently on feat/rec-15-parser

This branch appears to be for REC-15, but you're implementing REC-10.

Options:
1. [switch] - Switch to main and create feat/rec-10 branch
2. [stay] - Continue on this branch
3. [cancel] - Exit

Your choice:
```

### Step 4: Phase-by-Phase Execution Loop

**For each phase** in the execution queue:

#### Phase Start

1. **Display phase overview**:

   ```
   ========================================
   PHASE: Phase 2 - Core Implementation
   ========================================

   Tasks in this phase:
   1. [~] Implement connection handler (IN PROGRESS - resuming)
   2. [ ] Add message parsing
   3. [ ] Implement error handling

   Completed tasks (will skip):
   - [x] Define data structures

   Architecture section: WebSocket module
   Source files: src/websocket/
   ```

2. **Request phase approval**:
   - Ask user: "Ready to execute Phase 2? (yes/no/skip)"
   - **yes**: Proceed with task execution
   - **no**: Stop command completely
   - **skip**: Skip phase, proceed to next

#### Task Execution Loop

**For each task** in the approved phase:

##### Task 1: Mark Task as In Progress

1. Update plan file: Change `[ ]` to `[~]`
2. Update progress percentage
3. Save plan file
4. Display: "Starting: [Task name]"

##### Task 2: Read Context

**If design doc exists**:
1. Search for relevant section
2. Extract technical details, patterns, acceptance criteria

**Always read**:
- Architecture document for patterns
- Existing code in relevant modules for conventions

##### Task 3: Execute Implementation

**Based on task type**, use appropriate approach:

**Code Implementation Tasks**:

- Use `Read` to understand existing code patterns
- Use `Edit` or `Write` to implement
- Follow project conventions

**Test Tasks**:

```bash
# Run tests
cargo test

# Check coverage if configured
cargo tarpaulin
```

**Validation Tasks**:

```bash
# Format check
cargo fmt -- --check

# Lint check
cargo clippy
```

##### Task 4: Handle Errors

**If any step fails**:

1. **Mark task as blocked**: Update plan file `[~]` -> `[!]`
2. **Document error**:

   ```markdown
   - [!] Implement connection handler
     - BLOCKED: Compilation error
     - Error: "trait bound not satisfied"
     - Needs: Review trait implementations
   ```

3. **Ask user**:

   ```
   ERROR: Task failed during execution

   Task: Implement connection handler
   Error: Compilation error

   How would you like to proceed?
   1. [retry] - Try again (after fixing)
   2. [skip] - Mark as blocked and continue
   3. [stop] - Stop execution completely

   Your choice:
   ```

##### Task 5: Validate Completion

**Run validation commands**:

```bash
# Build check
cargo build

# Test check
cargo test

# Format check
cargo fmt -- --check
```

**If validation fails**: Ask user to fix or continue

##### Task 6: Mark Task as Complete

1. Update plan file: `[~]` -> `[x]`
2. Recalculate progress
3. Save plan file

##### Task 7: Create Git Commit

**Commit format** (conventional commits):

| Task Type | Commit Type |
|-----------|-------------|
| New feature | `feat(REC-XX):` |
| Bug fix | `fix(REC-XX):` |
| Refactoring | `refactor(REC-XX):` |
| Documentation | `docs(REC-XX):` |
| Tests | `test(REC-XX):` |

**Commit message template**:

```
feat(REC-XX): implement [concise description]

- [Specific change 1]
- [Specific change 2]

Related: docs/plan/rec-XX-[description].md
```

**Execute commit**:

```bash
git add <modified files>
git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
feat(REC-XX): implement [task]

- [Details...]

Related: docs/plan/rec-XX-[description].md
EOF
)"
```

**Let pre-commit hooks run** (never use `--no-verify` unless user explicitly requests)

##### Task 8: Update Status File (MANDATORY)

**ALWAYS update the status file after each task completion.**

**Add completed task entry to current session**:

```markdown
#### Tasks Completed This Session

- [x] [Task name from plan]
  - **Time**: [HH:MM]
  - **Module**: src/[module]/
  - **Files Modified**: [List of files]
  - **Commit**: [SHA or "pending"]

```

**Update header section**:

```markdown
**Last Updated**: [Current Date/Time]

## Current Status: In Progress

**Overall Progress**: X% (Y/Z tasks)
**Current Phase**: Phase N - [Name]
```

**Add to Technical Decisions** (if any decisions were made):

```markdown
## Technical Decisions

- **[Decision Topic]**: [What was decided and why]
  - Task: [Task name]
  - Alternatives considered: [If any]
```

##### Task 9: Display Task Completion

```
COMPLETED: [Task name]

Files changed: [count]

---

## Command Philosophy

**This command is designed to**:

1. **Automate implementation**: Follow patterns from architecture doc
2. **Maintain quality**: Validate after each task
3. **Track progress**: Update plan file and status in real-time
4. **Be resumable**: Continue where you left off
5. **Document thoroughly**: Create comprehensive status files
6. **Follow conventions**: Conventional commits, no emojis

**This command does NOT**:

1. **Make architecture decisions**: Follows plan and design docs
2. **Skip validation**: Always runs tests
3. **Hide errors**: Surfaces failures immediately
4. **Bypass hooks**: Always runs pre-commit (from CLAUDE.md)

---

## Aggregation Files

When a task reaches 100% completion, remind the user to update these project-level files:

| File | Purpose | What to Update |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `project.md` | Dashboard | Move task to "Recently Completed", update "Active Work" |
| `docs/plan/01-roadmap.md` | Big picture | Update task status, phase completion % |
| `docs/tasks/README.md` | Blockers | Update blockers, mark unblocked tasks as ready |

These files provide high-level project visibility and should be kept in sync with task completion.
