# Spec: Codex Context Injection Gating

**Status**: Draft
**Date**: 2026-05-25
**Related**: `docs/spec-context-compiler.md`, `docs/qa/sessionstart-context-smoke.md`

## 1. Background

Codex runs `SessionStart` hooks at the start of an agent task/turn. Plain hook
stdout is recorded as developer context, and structured JSON stdout can carry
the same model-visible context through
`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`. Later model requests are built from the
accumulated session history.

For remem, the installed Codex hook currently runs:

```text
remem context --host codex-cli
```

`remem context` renders a full startup context block every time it is invoked.
When the invocation is a Codex `SessionStart` hook, remem now serializes that
block as `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` instead of plain stdout. In a
single visible Codex thread, multiple user requests can create multiple
tasks/turns. Each task can therefore append another full remem context block to
the same conversation history unless duplicate-injection gating suppresses it.

This is correct from Codex's hook lifecycle, but it is not the desired remem behavior.

## 2. Problem

Repeated full context injection causes:

- prompt noise: the same preferences, core memories, workstreams, and sessions appear multiple times;
- token waste: each injected block remains eligible for future prompts until compaction or truncation;
- accidental re-weighting: repeated memories may look more important to the model than they are;
- poor UX: users see memory text "inserted in the middle" of a long chat;
- stale context risk: an old injected block can stay in history after a newer block is injected.

The core issue is not retrieval quality. It is lifecycle mismatch:

```text
remem assumes SessionStart means one visible conversation start
Codex uses SessionStart for task/turn startup inside a persistent thread
```

## 3. Goals

- Prevent duplicate full `remem context` blocks in the same Codex thread.
- Preserve high-quality first-turn context for new Codex sessions.
- Allow updated context to appear only when it materially changes.
- Keep the behavior deterministic and testable without vectors or external services.
- Keep failures safe: if gating state cannot be read or written, output the context and log the reason.
- Provide debug visibility so users can prove why context was emitted or suppressed.
- Keep Claude Code behavior unchanged unless explicitly enabled later.

## 4. Non-Goals

- No vector/reranker/hybrid retrieval change.
- No change to MCP tool contracts.
- No deletion or mutation of memories as part of injection gating.
- No Codex source patch in this work.
- No attempt to suppress Codex's own conversation history.
- No silent loss of first-turn context.
- No global one-context-per-project rule; independent Codex sessions must still get startup context.

## 5. Design Principle

SessionStart output should be **idempotent per Codex conversation**, not per process invocation.

The renderer still builds a high-quality context block. A gate decides whether
that block should be emitted, and the Codex `SessionStart` hook path serializes
emitted context as structured JSON:

```text
hook stdin / CLI args
  -> ContextInvocation
  -> render candidate context
  -> fingerprint candidate context
  -> ContextInjectionGate
  -> emit full context JSON | emit compact update JSON | emit nothing
```

No stdout means no developer context is injected by Codex. Diagnostics must go to remem logs or debug-only stderr, not stdout.

## 6. Current Code Anchors

| Area | Current behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `src/install/config.rs` | Installs Codex `SessionStart` as `remem context --host codex-cli`. |
| `src/cli/types.rs` | `context` already accepts `--session_id`, `--host`, `--debug`, but install does not pass session data. |
| `src/context/invocation.rs` | `context` parses Codex hook stdin for session, cwd, transcript, and source. |
| `src/context/render.rs` | Opens DB, loads context data, renders all sections, and wraps Codex `SessionStart` hook output as `hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext`; direct CLI output remains plain text. |
| `src/context/host.rs` | Codex profile is host-aware and already records that Codex is Stop/context-focused. |
| `docs/spec-context-compiler.md` | Defines the desired host-aware context compiler direction. |

## 7. Proposed Behavior

### 7.1 Default Codex Policy

For Codex `remem context --host codex-cli` hook invocations:

1. First invocation for a Codex session emits full context.
2. Later invocations for the same session emit nothing if the rendered context fingerprint is unchanged.
3. Later invocations may emit a compact update only when the fingerprint changes.
4. If the session cannot be identified, use a short fallback cooldown keyed by host + project + cwd + transcript path when available.
5. If gating fails due to DB or state errors, emit full context and log `gate=fail_open`.

For `claude-code` and `unknown`:

- preserve current behavior in the first implementation slice;
- allow future opt-in via env var after Codex behavior is stable.

### 7.2 Full Context

The full context is the existing rendered output, carried in JSON stdout as
`hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext` for Codex hooks:

```text
# [project @branch] context ...
Use `search`/`get_observations` ...
...
context memories loaded ...
```

It is emitted through the structured hook context path when:

- no prior successful full context exists for the same injection key;
- the caller uses `REMEM_CONTEXT_GATE=off`;
- debug smoke tests explicitly request `--debug --force`;
- gating state cannot be trusted and fail-open applies.

### 7.3 Suppressed Context

When context is unchanged for the same Codex session, stdout must be empty.

Log line:

```text
[context-gate] suppress host=codex-cli key=... reason=same_hash age=...s hash=...
```

The log is enough for diagnosis. Printing a "context skipped" message to stdout would still be injected into Codex history, so it is not allowed by default.

### 7.4 Compact Update

When the rendered context fingerprint changed within the same session, default behavior should still be conservative:

- emit a compact update, not the full block;
- include only changed section names, counts, and retrieval instruction;
- stay under `REMEM_CONTEXT_DELTA_CHAR_LIMIT` default `1200`.

Example additional context body:

```text
# [project @branch] remem context update
Memory context changed since the last injection. Use `search`/`get_observations` for details.

Changed sections: preferences, workstreams
Stats: 16 memories, 6 core, 10 indexed, 11 preferences, 5 sessions.
```

Rationale: a long-running Codex thread already has prior full context in history. The update should inform the model that retrievable context changed without duplicating the whole memory map.

## 8. Identity Model

### 8.1 Hook Input Parsing

Add a lightweight hook envelope parser for `remem context`.

Codex `SessionStart` hook input can include:

```json
{
  "session_id": "...",
  "cwd": "...",
  "transcript_path": "...",
  "model": "...",
  "target": {
    "type": "SessionStart",
    "source": "Startup"
  }
}
```

The parser must:

- read stdin with a short timeout, reusing the existing `read_stdin_with_timeout` pattern;
- accept empty stdin for manual CLI use;
- prefer CLI args over stdin values when both exist;
- never log the full raw stdin payload unless debug is enabled and truncated.

Proposed type:

```rust
pub(super) struct ContextInvocation {
    pub cwd: String,
    pub project: String,
    pub session_id: Option<String>,
    pub transcript_path: Option<String>,
    pub host: HostKind,
    pub source: Option<String>,
    pub model: Option<String>,
    pub force: bool,
    pub debug: bool,
}
```

### 8.2 Injection Key

Primary key:

```text
host + session_id + project
```

Fallback key when `session_id` is missing:

```text
host + project + normalized_cwd + transcript_path_hash
```

Last fallback:

```text
host + project + normalized_cwd
```

The last fallback must use a short cooldown because it can group unrelated manual invocations.

## 9. State Storage

Add a small runtime table to the main remem DB:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS context_injections (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    host TEXT NOT NULL,
    project TEXT NOT NULL,
    injection_key TEXT NOT NULL,
    session_id TEXT,
    transcript_path TEXT,
    context_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    output_mode TEXT NOT NULL,
    output_chars INTEGER NOT NULL,
    created_at_epoch INTEGER NOT NULL,
    updated_at_epoch INTEGER NOT NULL,
    last_emitted_epoch INTEGER NOT NULL,
    emit_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    suppress_count INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    UNIQUE(host, injection_key)
);

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_context_injections_project_seen
    ON context_injections(project, updated_at_epoch DESC);
```

`output_mode` values:

- `full`
- `delta`
- `suppressed`
- `fail_open`

State retention:

- keep at least 30 days;
- delete rows older than `REMEM_CONTEXT_GATE_RETENTION_DAYS`, default `30`;
- cleanup can run opportunistically during context gate evaluation.

## 10. Fingerprint

Hash the rendered candidate context after:

- section rendering;
- total char limit enforcement;
- stats footer generation.

Do not include:

- wall-clock timestamp in the header;
- debug trace;
- ANSI colors.

If the existing header contains a timestamp, the fingerprint function must normalize it before hashing. Otherwise unchanged memories would look changed every invocation.

Recommended fingerprint input:

```text
host
project
branch
retrieval_hint
preferences section body
core section body
index section body
workstreams section body
sessions section body
stats excluding total chars if affected only by timestamp
```

Use SHA-256 rather than `DefaultHasher`, because this is persisted across process runs.

## 11. Configuration

| Env var | Default | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `REMEM_CONTEXT_GATE` | `auto` | `auto`, `off`, `strict`, `delta` |
| `REMEM_CONTEXT_GATE_HOSTS` | `codex-cli` | Comma-separated hosts where gating applies. |
| `REMEM_CONTEXT_GATE_FALLBACK_COOLDOWN_SECS` | `900` | Cooldown when no session id exists. |
| `REMEM_CONTEXT_DELTA_CHAR_LIMIT` | `1200` | Max chars for compact update output. |
| `REMEM_CONTEXT_GATE_RETENTION_DAYS` | `30` | State retention. |
| `REMEM_CONTEXT_FORCE` | `0` | Emit full context and update gate state. |
| `REMEM_CONTEXT_GATE_DEBUG` | `0` | Log gate decision details. |

Mode semantics:

- `auto`: full once per session, suppress unchanged repeats, delta on changed hash.
- `off`: always emit full context; matches current behavior.
- `strict`: full once per session, suppress all later repeats even if hash changes.
- `delta`: same as auto, but always prefer delta over full after first emission.

CLI additions:

```text
remem context --force
remem context --gate off|auto|strict|delta
```

The CLI flags override env vars.

## 12. Algorithm

```text
run context command
  parse CLI args
  parse hook stdin with timeout
  resolve ContextInvocation
  build ContextRequest
  render candidate context into String, not stdout
  if host not gated:
      print candidate
      return
  compute normalized context hash
  load context_injections row by host + injection_key
  if force or no row:
      upsert row output_mode=full, hash=current_hash, emit_count += 1
      print full candidate
      return
  if row.context_hash == current_hash:
      update suppress_count += 1, updated_at_epoch=now, output_mode=suppressed
      print nothing
      return
  if gate mode strict:
      update suppress_count += 1, context_hash=current_hash, output_mode=suppressed
      print nothing
      return
  build compact delta
  update row context_hash=current_hash, output_mode=delta, emit_count += 1
  print compact delta
```

Important: "print nothing" means no stdout at all, including trailing newline.

## 13. Failure Policy

This feature must be fail-open for first-turn context quality.

| Failure | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Cannot read stdin | Continue with CLI/env/cwd values. |
| Cannot parse stdin | Continue, log truncated parse error. |
| Cannot open DB | Existing `render_empty_state` behavior can stay for no-data cases; gate logs `fail_open_no_db`. |
| Cannot read gate table | Print full candidate, log `fail_open_gate_read`. |
| Cannot write gate row | Print full candidate, log `fail_open_gate_write`. |
| Cannot hash context | Print full candidate, log `fail_open_hash`. |

Do not silently suppress context on errors.

## 14. Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Render-to-buffer boundary

Refactor `src/context/render.rs`:

- keep `generate_context(...) -> Result<()>` as CLI boundary;
- add `render_context(request: &ContextRequest) -> Result<RenderedContext>`;
- move `print!("{}", output)` to the outer boundary;
- include stats and section metadata in `RenderedContext`.

Suggested type:

```rust
pub(super) struct RenderedContext {
    pub output: String,
    pub stats: ContextRenderStats,
    pub section_hash_inputs: Vec<SectionHashInput>,
}
```

### Step 2: Context hook input parser

Add `src/context/invocation.rs`:

- parse CLI args + optional stdin;
- reuse or extract `read_stdin_with_timeout`;
- produce `ContextInvocation`;
- unit-test empty stdin, Codex stdin, CLI override, malformed JSON.

### Step 3: Gate state module

Add `src/context/gate.rs`:

- `ContextGateMode`;
- `ContextInjectionKey`;
- `ContextFingerprint`;
- `ContextGateDecision`;
- `evaluate_context_gate(conn, invocation, rendered)`.

Keep SQL isolated in this module.

### Step 4: Migration

Add migration:

```text
v016_context_injection_gate.sql
```

Update:

- `src/migrate/types.rs`
- `src/migrate/tests.rs`
- any schema status checks if needed.

### Step 5: CLI and install updates

Update:

- `src/cli/types.rs`: add `--force`, `--gate`.
- `src/cli/dispatch.rs`: route through invocation parser and gate.
- `src/install/config.rs`: keep command simple if stdin parsing works.
- `src/install/tests.rs`: assert Codex hook command remains host-tagged.

Do not add shell redirection in the installed hook. Suppression belongs in remem, not in the hook command.

### Step 6: Smoke docs

Update `docs/qa/sessionstart-context-smoke.md` with:

```bash
printf '{"session_id":"sess-1","cwd":"%s","transcript_path":"/tmp/codex.jsonl"}' "$PWD" \
  | REMEM_CONTEXT_HOST=codex-cli cargo run --quiet -- context

printf '{"session_id":"sess-1","cwd":"%s","transcript_path":"/tmp/codex.jsonl"}' "$PWD" \
  | REMEM_CONTEXT_HOST=codex-cli cargo run --quiet -- context | wc -c
```

Expected:

- first command emits full context;
- second command emits `0` bytes when context hash is unchanged.

## 15. Tests

### Unit Tests

Context invocation:

- parses Codex `SessionStart` JSON stdin;
- empty stdin falls back to cwd;
- CLI `--cwd` and `--session_id` override stdin;
- malformed stdin logs but does not fail the command.

Fingerprint:

- same context with different header timestamps has the same hash;
- changed preference/core/workstream/session content changes the hash;
- debug trace does not affect the hash.

Gate:

- first Codex invocation emits full context;
- second same-session same-hash invocation emits empty stdout;
- same session changed hash emits delta in `auto`;
- same session changed hash emits empty stdout in `strict`;
- `REMEM_CONTEXT_GATE=off` emits full every time;
- missing session id uses fallback cooldown;
- DB write failure fail-opens.

Migration:

- full migration on empty DB includes `context_injections`;
- migration SQL has no non-constant ALTER defaults;
- migration is idempotent.

### Integration / Smoke

Run:

```bash
cargo fmt --check
cargo check
cargo test context:: --lib
cargo test migrate:: --lib
cargo run --quiet -- context --cwd /Users/lifcc/Desktop/code/AI/tool/remem --host codex-cli --force
printf '{"session_id":"gate-smoke","cwd":"/Users/lifcc/Desktop/code/AI/tool/remem","transcript_path":"/tmp/remem-gate-smoke.jsonl"}' \
  | REMEM_CONTEXT_HOST=codex-cli cargo run --quiet -- context | wc -c
printf '{"session_id":"gate-smoke","cwd":"/Users/lifcc/Desktop/code/AI/tool/remem","transcript_path":"/tmp/remem-gate-smoke.jsonl"}' \
  | REMEM_CONTEXT_HOST=codex-cli cargo run --quiet -- context | wc -c
```

Expected:

- first `wc -c` is greater than `0`;
- second `wc -c` is `0` when no context changed.

Before submission:

```bash
cargo test
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
```

## 16. Observability

Add log lines with stable fields:

```text
[context-gate] emit host=codex-cli key=... mode=full hash=... chars=...
[context-gate] suppress host=codex-cli key=... reason=same_hash hash=...
[context-gate] emit host=codex-cli key=... mode=delta old_hash=... new_hash=... chars=...
[context-gate] fail_open host=codex-cli reason=gate_write error=...
```

Extend debug trace only when `REMEM_CONTEXT_DEBUG=1` or `--debug`:

```text
## Debug Trace
- gate mode=auto decision=suppressed key=... hash=...
```

Do not include gate debug trace in suppressed stdout. Suppressed means empty stdout.

## 17. Backward Compatibility

- Existing installed hooks keep working.
- Manual `remem context --cwd .` still prints full context unless host gating applies.
- `REMEM_CONTEXT_GATE=off` restores old behavior.
- Existing DBs migrate forward without data loss.
- No change to memory selection, scoring, or rendering quality in this spec.

## 18. Rollout

1. Land render-to-buffer and hook input parser behind no behavior change.
2. Land gate table and code with default `REMEM_CONTEXT_GATE=off` in tests only.
3. Enable default gating for `codex-cli`.
4. Run local Codex transcript smoke:
   - start a thread;
   - verify first task injects full context;
   - send a second user message in the same thread;
   - verify no duplicate remem developer block appears when hash is unchanged.
5. Update README / architecture docs after behavior is verified.

## 19. Risks

| Risk | Mitigation |
| --- | --- |
| First task loses context due to bad gate state | fail-open; `--force`; `REMEM_CONTEXT_GATE=off`. |
| Different Codex sessions collapse into one fallback key | prefer `session_id`; fallback cooldown only when session id missing. |
| Context changes are hidden too aggressively | default `auto` emits compact delta on hash change. |
| Timestamp makes every hash different | normalize timestamp before hashing. |
| Debug output gets injected | debug trace only when emitting; suppressed stdout stays empty. |
| State table grows forever | retention cleanup default 30 days. |

## 20. Open Questions

- Should `delta` include changed section item titles, or only section names and counts?
- Should `claude-code` opt into the same gate after Codex behavior proves stable?
- Should `remem doctor --target codex` report duplicate context injection count from `context_injections`?
- Should `remem status` expose recent gate suppressions and fail-open events?

## 21. Recommended First Slice

The first implementation slice should be deliberately small:

1. parse Codex hook stdin for `session_id`, `cwd`, and `transcript_path`;
2. render context to a buffer;
3. persist `context_injections`;
4. for `codex-cli`, emit full once per `session_id + project`, suppress identical repeats;
5. add `REMEM_CONTEXT_GATE=off` escape hatch;
6. add unit tests and the two-command smoke check.

Do not implement rich delta rendering in the first slice unless the suppress/full behavior is already stable.
